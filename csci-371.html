<center><b>What to Expect</b></center>
A hands-on intro to computer graphics.

<b>The Lecutres</b> will cover key points and interesting examples. You will work in groups. I will provide extensive documentation and notes for you to use outside of class.
<b>The Homework</b> will involve lots and lots of challenging programming in C/C++. I will be there to help you along the way.
<b>The Exam</b> will require you to apply challenging math in new ways. I will provide practice problems as we go.
<b>The Final Project</b> will be open-ended, time-consuming, and require you to think creatively. I think people enjoyed it last semester 🙂👍

Your final grade will have three parts.

+ 50% Homework,
+ 25% Exam,
+ 25% Final Project.

<hr>
<center><b>Homework</b></center>
You are highly encouraged to collaborate on homework provided you follow the spirit of the <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs171/materials/pdfs/50ft_policy.pdf">50 ft rule</a>.

Homework may have multiple tracks.

<b>The A Track</b> has a maximum possible grade of A (95%). I expect the majority of students to find the A-track challenging and rewarding.
<b>The S Track</b> has a maximum possible grade of A+ (105%). I expect a handful of particularly enthusiastic students to follow the S-track. <i>Note: It may be helpful to work through the A-track before attempting the S-track, but this is not required.</i> 

Homework is graded on two axes.

<b>Correctness:</b> Is the output correct? Is memory handled appropriately?
<b>Creative effort:</b> Was a substantial effort made to create something new/cool/interesting? <i>Note: you are *not* graded on artistry.</i>

Grades will be assigned on an S, A, B, C scale (no +"s or -"s).

<b>Maximum possible grade:</b> Homework that is correct and exhibits high creative effort.
<b>-1 full letter grade:</b>   Homework with some incorrectness or moderate creative effort.
<b>-2 full letter grades:</b>  Homework with major incorrectness or low creative effort.

<i>Example: For a particular hw, Andy completes the A-track perfectly and makes a huge creative effort. For the same hw, Sam completes the S-track mostly correctly and makes a reasonable creative effort. Both students get an A.</i>

Your homework will be returned to you graded with an explanation of the grade within 48 hours of the submission deadline.

You have until the following homework submission deadline to correct it for full points back.

<hr>
<center><b>Exam</b></center>
The exam is effectively a no-collaboration homework.

You may not ask your friends questions. You may not ask the TA"s questions. You are welcome to ask Jim qustions, though in the interest of fairness he is unlikely to be particularly helpful.

You may Google whatever you want, consult course notes, past homeworks, and the course textbooks (provided you don"t remove them from the lab).

You may write and run code.

You have a full week to finish the exam, though it is not meant to take longer than a regular homework.

The exam may also be corrected, though only for 50% points of the back.

<hr>
<center><b>Final Project</b></center>
The final project is effectively an open-ended multi-week Super Homework.

You may do your final project on whatever you like, provided you can answer the following questions.

0) What is the title of my project?
1) What is my project"s big "graphics method"? <i>Note: This should either be something that was not covered on a homework, or a significant extension of something that was.</i>
2) What is the world that I am proposing? Who or what lives in it? How does it *feel*?
3) (Game or other Interactive Art only) How will the player interact with my project?
4) Does Jim think my project is doable? What is my fallback plan if my project is harder than I expect?

<i>Here is a great example from last semester:
0) Archer
1) Physics-based simulation of a bow and arrow
2) A brightly-colored archery range
3) Click and drag to pull back arrow, release to shoot
4) Yes; yes: simulate only the string and render the bow without physics</i>
