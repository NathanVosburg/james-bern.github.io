Homework is due the first Monday after it is released at 8 pm.
Please contact me as soon as possible if you cannot meet a deadline. 🙂👍

Homework will be returned within 48 hours of the submission deadline.
You have until the following submission deadline to correct it for full points back.
- You can only correct problems you attempted before the regular deadline.
- You must submit a README.txt explaining what you have changed and why.

<center><b>What to Expect</b></center>
A hands-on intro to computer graphics.

<b>The Lectures</b> will cover key points and technically interesting examples. There will be group activities. There will be movies.
<b>The Homework</b> will involve lots of challenging programming in C/C++. I will be there to help you along the way.
<b>The Exam</b> will require you to apply challenging mathematical concepts in new ways. I will provide practice problems as we go.
<b>The Final Project</b> will be open-ended, time-consuming, and require you to get creative. I think people enjoyed it last semester 🙂👍

Your final grade will have three parts.

+ 60% Homework,
+ 20% Exam,
+ 20% Final Project.

<hr>
<center><b>Homework</b></center>
You are highly encouraged to collaborate on homework provided you follow the spirit of the <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs171/materials/pdfs/50ft_policy.pdf">50 ft rule</a>.


Homework is graded on two axes.

<b>Correctness:</b> Is the output correct? Is memory handled appropriately?
<b>Creative Effort:</b> Was a substantial effort made to create something new/cool/interesting? <i>Note: you are *not* graded on artistry.</i>

<i>Note: You are *not* graded on comments, style, what you named your variables, etc. However, you are graded on whether your code crashes.</i>


Grades will be assigned on an A, B, C, S scale.

<b>A:</b> Homework that is correct and exhibits high creative effort.
<b>B:</b> Homework with some incorrectness or moderate creative effort.
<b>C:</b> Homework with major incorrectness or low creative effort.
<b>S (A+):</b> A-tier homework that goes above and beyond (either by completing a challenging extra credit question or by pushing the regular assignment further than anticipated)

<hr>
<center><b>Exam</b></center>
The exam is effectively a no-collaboration homework.

You may *not* ask your friends questions. You may *not* ask the TA's questions. You are welcome to ask Jim questions, though to ensure the exam is fair he is unlikely to be particularly helpful.

You may Google whatever you want, consult course notes, past homework, and textbooks (you can use my copies, provided you share and don't remove them from the lab).

You may write and run code.


You have a full week to finish the exam, though it is not meant to take longer than a regular homework.


You can also submit corrections for the exam, though you will receive a maximum of 50% of the missed points back.

<hr>
<center><b>Final Project</b></center>
The final project is effectively an open-ended multi-week Super Homework.

You may do your final project on whatever you like, provided you can answer the following questions.

0) What is the title of my project?
1) What is my project's big "graphics method"? <i>Note: This should either be something that was not covered on a homework, or a significant extension of something that was.</i>
2) What is the world that I am proposing? Who or what lives in it? How does it *feel*?
3) Will the viewer/player interact with my project? How so?
4) Does Jim think my project is doable? What is my fallback plan if my project ends up being harder/more time-consuming than I expect?

<i>Here is a great example:
0) Archer
1) Physics-based simulation of a bow and arrow
2) A brightly-colored archery range; just the player and some clouds; feels fun and friendly
3) Click and drag to pull back arrow, release to shoot
4) Yes; if simulating the bow with torsional springs is too hard, then I plant to simulate only the string and render the bow using a geometric method</i>
