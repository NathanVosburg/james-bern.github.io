<center><b>Syllabus</b></center>
<b>Overview:</b> This is a very hands-on intro to computer graphics. <!-- We will cover some fundamental methods for representing, rendering, and animating 3D content. We are unlikely to cover much specific software (e.g., Maya, ZBrush, C4D, Speedtree), though can do a bit if there is interest üôÇüëç -->

<b>What to Expect:</b>
The homework will involve lots and lots of challenging programming in C/C++; I will be there to help you along the way. The exam will require you to apply challenging math in new ways; I will provide practice problems as we go. The final project will be open-ended, time-consuming, and require you to think creatively; people enjoyed it last semester.

<b>Grading:</b> The final semester grade is
+ 50% Homework,
+ 25% Exam,
+ 25% Final Project.



<b>Collaboration Policies</b>
- <b>Homework</b>:</b> You are highly encouraged to collaborate on homework provided you follow the spirit of the <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs171/materials/pdfs/50ft_policy.pdf">50 ft rule</a>.
- <b>Exams:</b> You may not collaborate on the exam.
- <b>Project:</b> TBA

<b>External Resources Policies</b>
- <b>Homework:</b> You may Google and look at Stack Overflow to your heart's content. However, under no circumstances may you submit any code that isn't yours (unless it is code I gave you, i.e. starter code).
- <b>Exam:</b> The exam is open everything except people. You may write and compile code, try to Google the answers to questions, and consult recommended textbooks. You may not ask your friends for help. You may not *post* questions on Stack Overflow.
- <b>Project:</b> TBA



<b>Textbooks:</b> We do not have an official textbook for this course. These resources may be helpful, especially for the final project.
