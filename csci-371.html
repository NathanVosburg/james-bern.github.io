<center><b>syllabus</b></center>
<b>Overview:</b> This is an introductory computer graphics course with a special emphasis on hands-on learning. We will write challenging* implementations from the ground up. 
<i>*This course will meet you where you are. You are not expected to already know math or programming beyond the prereqs.</i>

Our high-level trajectory is

I.   Fundamentals of code and math.
II.  Learn how to build a virtual world.
III. Learn how to render a virtual world.
IV.  Learn how to animate a virtual world.
V.   Break out of the computer screen and into the real world.

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> This course is designed to help you become confident coding larger, more complicated computer programs. We will implement and experiment with fundamental techniques required to build, render, and animate virtual worlds.


<b>Grading:</b> The final semester grade is broken down as
+ (9 - 1) * 7.5% = 60% Homework (lowest scoring homework automatically dropped),
+                  20% Final Project,
+                  10% Midterm Exam,
+                  10% Final Exam.
Final semester grades may be curved, but only up (the curve cannot make your final letter grade worse than it would be on a 90-100% = A, 80-89% = B, ... scale).


<b>Collaboration Policies</b>
- <b>Homework</b> and <b>Final Project:</b> You are encouraged to collaborate on homework and the final project, including discussing solution strategies and helping each other debug. However, you must follow the <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs171/materials/pdfs/50ft_policy.pdf">50 ft rule</a>. All code you submit must be your own.
- <b>Exams:</b> You may not collaborate on the exams.

<b>External Resources Policies</b>
- <b>Homework:</b> You may google and look at stack overflow to your heart's content. However, you may not copy and paste code. All code you submit must be your own.
- <b>Final Project:</b> You may copy and paste code so long as you 1) discuss it with me first and 2) cite your sources.
- <b>Exams:</b> You may not use external resources on the exams.


<b>Lectures:</b> Lectures will give you the background and tools to succeed on the homework. Lectures may also cover more advanced techniques that are not on the homework*, however the emphasis is on techniques we will actually implement.
<i>*These topics can be great candidates for a Final Project special method!</i>
          
<b>Labs:</b> Lab sections are a chance to collaborate with your classmates and receive help from me on homework. No need to code in a vacuum!

<b>Homework:</b> Homeworks are your biggest chance to learn by doing. Your lowest scoring homework is automatically dropped. Homeworks may have extra credit problems.

<b>Final Project:</b> The final project is your chance to 1) synthesize the techniques from this course in a creative way, and 2) dive deeper into a method of particular interest. The tentative spec for the final project is already available* <a href="#" style='color: #888'>here</a>, though is subject to change.
<i>*You are not expected to start the final project before it is formally released.</i>

<b>Exams:</b> The exams will test graphics theory and programming covered by the homework. The midterm will be on the first half of the course. The final will primarily be on the second half of the course, but may build upon first half material as necessary.

<b>Textbooks:</b> We do not have an official textbook for this course. However, the following resources may be useful, especially for your final project:
- <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">Learn OpenGL</a> (free!)
- <a href="https://graphicscodex.courses.nvidia.com/app.html">the Graphics Codex</a> (free!)
- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Computer-Graphics-Steve-Marschner-ebook-dp-B098TWMBV4/dp/B098TWMBV4/">Fundamentals of Computer Graphics</a> (I have a hard copy for use during lab.)
- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Rendering-Fourth-Tomas-Akenine-Mo-ebook/dp/B07FSKB982/">Real-Time Rendering</a> (I have a hard copy for use during lab.)


<b>Inclusivity</b> Williams College values an inclusive environment, and so do I. In this class, we welcome anyone regardless of age, background, beliefs, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, and other visible and non visible categories. I am available to address any questions or concerns (either in person or via email.)

<b>Health/Accessibility Resources:</b> Students with disabilities or disabling conditions who experience barriers in this course are encouraged to contact me to discuss options for access and full course participation. The Office of Accessible Education is also available to facilitate the removal of barriers and to ensure access and reasonable accommodations.
