<center><b>Syllabus</b></center>
<b>Overview:</b> This is an introductory computer graphics course with a special emphasis on hands-on learning. We will write challenging* implementations from the ground up. 
<i>*This course will meet you where you are. You are not expected to already know math or programming beyond the prereqs.</i>

Our high-level trajectory is

0. FUNdaMENTAL <u>code and math</u> (vectors, matrices, simplex, clamp, lerp, data, malloc, dynamic array, notion of a simplex, assert, macro magic, visual debugger),
1. Learn how to <u>build</u> a virtual world (geometry, transforms, texture, widgets, imgui),
2. Learn how to <u>render</u> a virtual world (ray tracing, rasterization),
3. Learn how to <u>animate</u> a virtual world (IK, physics-based),
4. Break out of the computer screen and into <u>the real world</u> (fabrication, robotics).

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> This course is designed to help you become confident coding larger, more complicated computer programs. We will implement and experiment with fundamental techniques required to <u>build</u>, <u>render</u>, and <u>animate</u> virtual worlds.

<b>Grading:</b> The final semester grade is broken down as

(9 - 1) * 7.5% = 60% Homework (your lowest scoring homework is automatically dropped),
                 20% Final Project,
                 10% Midterm Exam,
                 10% Final Exam.

Final semester grades may be curved, but only up (the curve cannot make your final letter grade worse than it would be on a 90-100% = A, 80-89% = B, ... scale).

<b>Lectures:</b> Lectures will give you the background and tools to succeed on the homework. Lectures may also cover more advanced techniques that are not on the homework*, however the emphasis is on techniques we will actually implement.
<i>*These topics can be great candidates for a Final Project special method!</i>
          
<b>Homework:</b> Homeworks are the biggest chance to learn by doing. TODO Late homework will not be accepted without TODO. Your lowest scoring homework is automatically dropped. TODO_COLLAB

<b>Labs:</b> Lab sections are a chance to collaborate with your classmates and receive help from me on homework. No need to code in a vacuum!

<b>Final Project:</b> The final project is your chance to 1) synthesize the techniques from this course in a creative way, and 2) dive deeper into a method of particular interest. The tentative spec for the final project is already available* <a href="#" style='color: #777'>here</a>, though is subject to change.
<i>*You are not expected to start the final project before it is formally released.</i>

<b>Exams:</b> The exams will test graphics theory and programming covered by the homework. The midterm will be on the first half of the course. The final will primarily be on the second half of the course, but may build upon first half material as necessary.

<b>Health/Accessibility Resources:</b> Students with disabilities or disabling conditions who experience barriers in this course are encouraged to contact me to discuss options for access and full course participation. The Office of Accessible Education is also available to facilitate the removal of barriers and to ensure access and reasonable accommodations.  Students with documented disabilities or disabling conditions of any kind who may need accommodations for this course or who have questions about appropriate resources are encouraged to contact the Office of Accessible Education at oaestaff@williams.edu.
