<b>non-optional reading. coordinate systems</b>


a coordinate system is an x-axis $\mathbf{\hat x}$, a y-axis $\mathbf{\hat y}$, a z-axis $\mathbf{\hat z}$, and an origin $\mathbf{o}$
the axes are vectors and the origin is a point

<b>note:</b> here it is implied that the quantities $\mathbf{\hat x}, \mathbf{\hat y}, \mathbf{\hat z}, \mathbf{o}$ are written <i>in world coordinates</i>
- they have to be written in something!

<b>note:</b> *unlike the slides from class,* here it is implied that everything is written in homogeneous coordinates
- this makes the derivation way cleaner


it is convenient to pack a coordinate system into a 4x4 matrix like this
$\mathbf{C} = \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{\hat x} & \mathbf{\hat y} & \mathbf{\hat z} & \mathbf{o} \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
{\hat x}_x & {\hat y}_x & {\hat z}_x & {o}_x \\
{\hat x}_y & {\hat y}_y & {\hat z}_y & {o}_y \\
{\hat x}_z & {\hat y}_z & {\hat z}_z & {o}_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$
to do this in code, you could call <code>mat4 M4_xyzo(vec3 x, vec3 y, vec3 z, vec3 o);</code>
<b>note:</b> observe that the world coordinate system (in world coordinates) is the 4x4 identity matrix


consider a point <i>written in coordinate system $\mathbf{C}$</i> as $\mathbf{p_C} = (x_\mathbf{C}, y_\mathbf{C}, z_\mathbf{C}, 1)^T$
note that $\mathbf{p}_\text{world} = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{p_C} = \mathbf{o} + x_\mathbf{C} \mathbf{\hat x} + y_\mathbf{C} \mathbf{\hat y} + z_\mathbf{C} \mathbf{\hat z}$
i.e., we start at the origin $\mathbf{o}$ and then walk along each axes by the prescribed amounts (just like plotting points in Algebra 1)
to do this in code, you could call <code>vec3 transformPoint(mat4 C, vec3 p_C);</code>


a similar fact is true for vectors; considering vector $\mathbf{v_C}$ written in coordinate system $\mathbf{C}$, we have $\mathbf{v}_\text{world} = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{v_C}$
to do this in code, you could call <code>vec3 transformVector(mat4 C, vec3 v_C);</code>

there are a few special coordinate systems that we give names

<b>model coordinates</b> (aka modeling coordinates, aka object coordinates)
- this is the coordinate system of a single mesh
-- if you ever sculpt/model in Blender or zBrush, you're working in model coordinates
-- when you were scripting up the cylinder by hand, you were working in model coordinates

<b>camera coordinates</b>
- this is the coordinate system of a virtual camera
-- by convention, the camera's x-axis (red) points its right, and y-axis (green) points up
--- assuming a right-handed coordinate system, this means the camera's z-axis (blue) points out its back

<b>world coordinates</b>
- this is the coordinate system of the world (scene)
-- when you place an object in the scene, you're working in world coordinates

<b>normalized device coordinates (NDC)</b>
- when OpenGL actually draws, it assumes vertices are in NDC
- the lower left is $(-1.0, -1.0)^T$ and the upper right is $(1.0, 1.0)^T$
- this is a very useful coordinate system for getting (usefully scaled) mouse movement!
-- <code>globals.mouse_change_in_position_NDC</code> is a <code>vec2</code> telling you how far the user moved their mouse since the last frame (in NDC!)

<hr color="lightblue">
there are a few special matrices that we give names

<b>model matrix</b> $\mathbf{M}$
- it takes us to world coordinates <i>from</i> model coordinates, i.e. $\mathbf{p}_\text{world} = \mathbf{M}\mathbf{p}_\text{model}$
- a convenient way to build a model matrix is $\mathbf{TRS}$
-- this is a 3D scaling by $\mathbf{s}$, followed by a 3D rotation $\mathbf{R}$, followed by a 3D translation by $\mathbf{t}$
   i.e., $\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{R}\text{diag}(\mathbf{s}) & \mathbf{t} \\ \mathbf{0}^T & 1\end{bmatrix}$

<b>camera matrix</b> $\mathbf{C}$
- the camera matrix is the camera's axes and origin packed into a 4x4 homogeneous matrix $\mathbf{C} = \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{\hat x} & \mathbf{\hat y} & \mathbf{\hat z} & \mathbf{o} \end{bmatrix}$
- the camera matrix takes us to world coordinates <i>from</i> camera coordinates, i.e., $\mathbf{p}_\text{world} = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{p}_\text{camera}$
- we can also see a (typical) camera matrix as a rotation followed by a translation $\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{R} & \mathbf{t} \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
-- this is NOT how we'll build all the cameras in this homework!

<b>view matrix</b> $\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{C}^{-1}$
- the view matrix is the inverse of the camera matrix
- the view matrix takes us to camera coordinates <i>from</i> world coordinates, i.e., $\mathbf{p}_\text{camera} = \mathbf{V}\mathbf{p}_\text{world}$

<b>projection matrix</b> $\mathbf{P}$
- the projection matrix takes us to NDC <i>from</i> camera coordinates, i.e., $\mathbf{p}_\text{NDC} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{p}_\text{camera}$

<b>"transform"</b> $\mathbf{PVM}$
- it takes us alllll the way to NDC <i>from</i> model coordinates
- <code>soup_draw(mat4 PVM, ...);</code> takes this

<hr color="lightblue">
special camera matrix constructions sometimes sort of get names
- you're welcome to google (e.g. "orbit camera graphics") for help, but please first try them without googling
-- all of these cameras can be figured out from first principles (i.e., that a camera points along its negative z-axis)
--- also a little trial and error

i call the <code>ORBIT_CAMERA</code> an <code>OrbitCamera</code>
- it always points at the world origin
- it has a notion of the world y-axis being "up"

i call the <code>HUMAN_CAMERA</code> an <code>FPSCamera</code> (first person shooter camera)
- it has a notion of where the payer is standing
- it has a notion of the world y-axis being "up"
 
i call the <code>TRACK_CAMERA</code> a <code>TrackingCamera</code>, but it is more typically known as a "lookAt" camera (after some long forgotten function in an old OpenGL helper library)
- it "looks at" a target (note that internally <code>TrackingCamera</code> stores this target as a pointer; you can just dereference this pointer and use it inside of <code>get_C</code>)
- it has a notion of the world y-axis being "up"
 
i call the <code>PLANE_CAMERA</code> an <code>ArbitraryCamera</code>
- by this i just mean that we specify the rotation and translation directly (the consturction really isn't much)
-- for (very inefficient) convenience, we'll specify the rotation as a <code>mat4</code>

<hr color="lightblue">
<b>sidenote:</b> sometimes we talk about <i>pixel coordinates</i> (especially when writing a GUI)
- e.g., the lower left is $(0, 0)^T$ and the upper right is $(W, H)^T,$ where $W$ and $H$ are the screen width and height in pixels
-- <b>note:</b> another common choice would be to make $(0, 0)^T$ the <i>upper</i> left and $(W, H)^T$ to lower right.


<b>sidenote:</b> $\mathbf{VM}$ is sometimes called the <i>model-view</i> matrix (reading right to left)
- note $\mathbf{p}_\text{camera} = \mathbf{VM}\mathbf{p}_\text{model}$


<b>sidenote:</b> instead of writing $\mathbf{M}, \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{V}, \mathbf{P}$, we could adopt a more explicit and general-purpose notation using left and right subscripts, where the $\mathbf{F}$ is read as "from"

- model matrix ${}_\text{world}\mathbf{F}_\text{model} $, where $\mathbf{p}_\text{world} = {}_\text{world}\mathbf{F}_\text{model}  \ \mathbf{p}_\text{model}$
- camera matrix ${}_\text{world}\mathbf{F}_\text{camera}$, where $\mathbf{p}_\text{world} = {}_\text{world}\mathbf{F}_\text{camera} \ \mathbf{p}_\text{camera}$
- view matrix ${}_\text{camera}\mathbf{F}_\text{world}$, where $\mathbf{p}_\text{camera} = {}_\text{camera}\mathbf{F}_\text{world} \ \mathbf{p}_\text{world}$
- projection matrix ${}_\text{NDC}\mathbf{F}_\text{camera}  $, where $\mathbf{p}_\text{NDC} = {}_\text{NDC}\mathbf{F}_\text{camera}   \ \mathbf{p}_\text{camera}$

in this notation, it is clear that, e.g., $\mathbf{p}_\text{NDC} = {}_\text{NDC}\mathbf{F}_\text{camera} \ {}_\text{camera}\mathbf{F}_\text{world} \ {}_\text{world}\mathbf{F}_\text{model} \ \mathbf{p}_\text{model}$

in code you could write <code>mat4 NDC_from_camera;</code>, etc.

<b>a. mini world</b>

<b>note:</b> i expect questions marked with a * to be substantially trickier
<b>note:</b> when i say, e.g., "very similar to MineCraft," i mean that the mouse controls (in this case, moving the mouse) should "feel" the same
- don't forget to check extreme cases!--what happens if you zoom in real far?--what happens if you drag down really far?

<details><summary>HINT (what to expect)</summary>
- correct answers can be *short* :)
- the <code>M4_*(...)</code> functions are your friends here
- and <code>transformVector(...)</code> can be nice too, but is less crucial
- take your time to make the controls feel good (check extreme cases!--what happens when you zoom really far, drag the mouse really far down, etc.)

<b>i. compute $\mathbf{C}$ for the various cameras</b> (more details in the code)
- complete <code>orbit_camera_get_C(...)</code>
- complete <code>fps_camera_get_C(...)</code>
* complete <code>tracking_camera_get_C(...)</code>
- complete <code>arbitrary_camera_get_C(...)</code>

<b>ii. implement controls for the various camera</b> (more details in the code)
- complete <code>orbit_camera_move(...)     // should feel very similar to Camera3D</code> (except that the world origin should remain in the exact center of your screen--i.e. we have no notion of offsetting the origin)
* complete <code>fps_camera_move(...)       // should feel ~exactly like MineCraft</code>
* complete <code>arbitrary_camera_move(...) // should feel like you're flying a plane (ish)</code>

<b>iii. complete</b> <code>draw_basic_box_with_fake_shadows(...) // should look like the sun is directly overhead</code>

<b>iv. creative coding</b> (choose 3+ of the following suggestions or equivalent)
- add your bouncy castle from hw03
- let the human sprint (run faster) when holding shift
- let the human jump with the spacebar
* let the human shoot bullets with the left mouse
* make the tracking camera shoot bullets automatically
* let the plane shoot rockets with the left mouse; the rockets could explode on impact with the ground?
* add an AI to make the human walk when <code>selected_camera != HUMAN_CAMERA</code>
* add an AI to make the plane fly around when <code>selected_camera != PLANE_CAMERA</code>
- add mesh(es) for the human (perhaps a teapot could be nice to start)
- add mesh(es) for the plane (maybe with a spinning propellor?)
- add mesh(es) for the tracking camera (eye of sauron could be cool)
* let the human jump onto obstacles (implement box-box collisions)

<b>‚òï. (extra credit) a wild fprintf and fscanf appeared; they look angry</b>

- save the teapot mesh to a file <b>teapot.obj</b> following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">obj</a> format
-- you will need to write, e.g., <code>void save_obj(IndexedTriangleMesh3D mesh, char *filename);</code> yourself
- load the mesh into <a href="https://www.meshlabjs.net/">meshlabjs</a> and run something fun (e.g., Quadric Simplification)
- download the resulting mesh as an obj
- load the resulting mesh into a cow app and draw it
-- (feel free to mess with the result from meshlabjs in a text editor a bit before loading to make your life easier)
