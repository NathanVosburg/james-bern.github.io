ohno D:


on the bright side i've already got the color and depth buffers all set up for you, and everything (matrices, mesh, etc.) is already being passed to <code>rasterize(...)</code> as an argument :)


<b>0. get familiar with the texture functions</b>

- try calling <code>texture_set_pixel(color_buffer, 16, 4, monokai.orange, 0.5);</code>
-- this sets the $(i, j)$-th pixel in the color buffer to be 50%-transparent orange
--- $i$ refers to the $i$-th *row* of pixels (i.e., the pixel's $y$-coordinate in pixel coordinates)
--- $j$ refers to the $j$-th *column* of pixels (i.e., the pixel's $x$-coordinate in pixel coordinates)
--- by zooming in carefully, verify that this pixel is in fact transparent orange

- duplicate and adapt the above exercise to prove to yourself you can write to the depth buffer as well
-- press Z to toggle viewing the color buffer and the depth buffer


<b>i. clear the color buffer and depth buffer</b> (more details in the code)

- for simplicity, our "screen" is a square
-- to get its side length, write, e.g., <code>int side_length_in_pixels = color_buffer->width;</code>

- please run the code to verify you did this correctly
- press Z to toggle viewing the color buffer and the depth buffer
-- a cleared color buffer could be 50%-transparent white
-- a cleared depth buffer should be full red (1.0 is max depth)


<b>ii. rasterize the triangles without worrying about color</b> (e.g., draw them all blue)
- this would be a good time to refresh yourself on the <code>IndexedTriangleMesh3D</code>

<b>iii. add color</b> (according to mesh->vertex_colors)

<b>iv. implement depth testing (z buffering)</b>
- verify that the overlap is correct
- again, you can press Z to toggle viewing the color buffer and the depth buffer

<b>v. get the bunny drawing (slowly)</b> (more details in the code)
- the bunny mesh doesn't include vertex_colors by default
-- instead, please use the formula $(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)^T + 0.5 * \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ to calculate a vertex's color, where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is that vertex's normal in model coordinates
- make sure you take into account the model matrix $\mathbf{M}$ if you ignored it before (for the first example mesh, it was the identity)

<b>vi. make the rasterizer FAST(er)</b>
- real-time should be fairly easy (ish) :)

<b>vii. creative coding</b> (choose 0+ of the following suggestions or equivalent)

<b>‚úÇ. clipping</b> (choose 0+ of the following suggestions or equivalent)
