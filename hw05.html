- understand rasterization

<hr color="black">
<b>highly-recommended reading. rasterization</b>


let's draw a triangle mesh on a screen; no OpenGL required :)


consider a single triangle with model-space vertex positions $(\mathbf{a}^\text{model}, \mathbf{b}^\text{model}, \mathbf{c}^\text{model})$
and corresponding vertex colors $(\mathbf{color}_a, \mathbf{color}_b, \mathbf{color}_c)$


note that our notation here is a little different than you may be used to
$\mathbf{a}^\text{model} = \begin{bmatrix}a_x^\text{model} \\ a_y^\text{model} \\ a_z^\text{model}\end{bmatrix}$ is a point $\mathbf{a}$ written in model coordinates
$\mathbf{color}_a$ is the vertex color of vertex $\mathbf{a}$


you know how to transform vertex positions into various coordinate systems, e.g.,
$(\mathbf{a}^\text{world}, \mathbf{b}^\text{world}, \mathbf{c}^\text{world})$, and $(\mathbf{a}^\text{camera}, \mathbf{b}^\text{camera}, \mathbf{c}^\text{camera})$, $(\mathbf{a}^\text{NDC}, \mathbf{b}^\text{NDC}, \mathbf{c}^\text{NDC})$


now let's talk pixels
consider the $(i, j)$-th pixel ($i$-th row, $j$-th column)
we can convert this pixel's position into NDC, which we denote $\mathbf{p}^\text{NDC}$
if $\mathbf{p}^\text{NDC}$ lies inside the NDC projection of the triangle, then we should consider drawing it!

<b>screen-space interpolation</b>

it is tempting to use these barycentric weights (which were found in NDC) directly, to interpolate both $z^\text{camera}$ and $\mathbf{color}$
$z^\text{camera} = \alpha{a_z^\text{camera}} + \beta{b_z^\text{camera}} + \gamma{c_z^\text{camera}}$ 
$\mathbf{color} = \alpha{\mathbf{color}_a} + \beta{\mathbf{color}_b} + \gamma{\mathbf{color}_c}$ 


unfortunately, this approach is incorrect (but feel free to use it on this homework, as for what we're doing it looks okay)
<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkl/publications/lowk_persp_interp_techrep.pdf">here</a> is a derivation of how to interpolate properly, the punchline of which is

$z^\text{camera} = \frac{1}{\alpha\frac{1}{a_z^\text{camera}} + \beta\frac{1}{b_z^\text{camera}} + \gamma\frac{1}{c_z^\text{camera}}}$ 

$\mathbf{color} = \frac{{\alpha\frac{\mathbf{color}_a}{a_z^\text{camera}} + \beta\frac{\mathbf{color}_b}{b_z^\text{camera}} + \gamma\frac{\mathbf{color}_c}{c_z^\text{camera}}}}{\frac{1}{z^\text{camera}}}$

<b>a. software rasterizer</b>


<b>note:</b> this homework is hard.


<details><summary>HINT (what to expect)</summary>
 - a correct solution should be relatively short; my real-time bunny solution to <code>rasterize(...)</code> is only about 60 lines

- üö® mind your coordinate systems (what should be in cmaera space, NDC, etc.?)

- ‚ú® <code>transformPoint(...)</code> is your friend :)

</details>

<details><summary>HINT (possibly useful functions and fields)</summary>
<code class="x">inverse(...)
INVERSE_LERP(...)
LINEAR_REMAP(...)
MAX(...)
MIN(...)
real(...) // just a cast
texture_set_pixel(...)
texture_get_pixel(...)
transformPoint(...)</code></details>

<hr color="lightblue">

<b>note:</b> we will be working entirely inside of the <code>rasterize(...)</code> function
find your way on in there now
note that it is totally empty
ohno D:


on the bright side i've already got the color and depth buffers all set up for you, and everything (matrices, mesh, etc.) is already being passed to <code>rasterize(...)</code> as an argument :)


<b>0. get familiar with the texture functions</b>

- try calling <code>texture_set_pixel(color_buffer, 16, 4, monokai.orange, 0.5);</code> inside of the <code>rasterize(...)</code> function
-- this sets the $(i, j)$-th pixel in the color buffer to be 50%-transparent orange
--- $i$ refers to the $i$-th *row* of pixels (i.e., the pixel's $y$-coordinate in pixel coordinates)
--- $j$ refers to the $j$-th *column* of pixels (i.e., the pixel's $x$-coordinate in pixel coordinates)
--- by zooming in carefully, verify that this pixel is in fact transparent orange

- duplicate and adapt the above exercise to prove to yourself you can write to the depth buffer as well
-- press Z to toggle viewing the color buffer and the depth buffer


<b>i. clear the color buffer and depth buffer</b> (more details in the code)

- NOTE: please don't worry about doing this fast; pixel by pixel is fine :)
- for simplicity, our "screen" is a square (same number of rows and columns of pixels)
-- to get its side length, write, e.g., <code>int side_length_in_pixels = color_buffer->width;</code>

- please run the code to verify you did this correctly
- press Z to toggle viewing the color buffer and the depth buffer
-- a cleared color buffer could be 50%-transparent white
-- a cleared depth buffer should be full red; (min depth is 0.0 (black); max depth is 1.0 (red))


<b>ii. rasterize the triangles without worrying about color</b> (e.g., draw them all blue)
- this would be a good time to refresh yourself on the <code>IndexedTriangleMesh3D</code>


<b>iii. add color</b> (according to mesh->vertex_colors)


<b>iv. implement depth testing (z buffering)</b>

- the near and far clip planes are at $z_\text{near}$ and $z_\text{far}$ respectively

- verify that the overlap in the example mesh is correct
-- again, you can press Z to toggle viewing the color buffer and the depth buffer


<b>v. get the bunny drawing (slowly)</b> (more details in the code)
- the bunny mesh doesn't include vertex_colors by default
-- instead, please use the formula $(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)^T + 0.5 * \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ to calculate a vertex's color, where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is that vertex's normal in model coordinates
- make sure you take into account the model matrix $\mathbf{M}$ if you ignored it before (for the first example mesh, it was the identity)


<b>vi. make the rasterizer FAST(er)</b>
- real-time should be fairly easy (ish) :)


<b>vii. creative coding (choose 1+ of the following or equivalent)</b>
- add a checkbox to <a href="https://asapguide.com/ezoimgfmt/b2249953.smushcdn.com/2249953/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dog-inverted-colors-1536x805.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb1%2Frs%3Adevice%2Frscb1-1&lossy=0&strip=1&webp=1">invert the colors</a> of the final image you rasterize into the color buffer
- add a checkbox to grayscale the final image you rasterize into the color buffer (if you want to get fancy, feel free to, e.g., convert to HSV)
‚òÅ  add a checkbox to blur the final image you rasterize into the color buffer (google "blur kernel"--you may want to make another texture)
üåü add a checkbox to do edge detection (using a kernel) and then composite those edges onto the final image (so the bunny appears *outlined*) :)


<b>‚úÇ. clipping</b>
- hack together an example mesh similar to the "external triangle" example in this <a href="http://simonstechblog.blogspot.com/2012/04/software-rasterizer-part-1.html">blog post</a> and verify it breaks our rasterizer :(
- fix it (i.e., add some hacky clipping inside of <code>rasterize(...)</code>, in whatever coordiante system you like) :)
