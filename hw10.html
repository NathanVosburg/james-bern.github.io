<b>a. pendulum</b>

Consider a 2D pendulum with length $L$ and mass $m = 1.0 \text{kg}$ concentrated at the bottom.
Recall gravitational acceleration to be $g = -9.81 \text{m}/{\text{s}}^2$.

<img src="pendulum.png" height="256px">

Notate the mass's <i>angular position</i> $\theta$, measured counter-clockwise from the negative $y$-axis.
It follow that the mass's spatial position is $\mathbf{p} = L\begin{bmatrix}\sin(\theta)\\ -\cos(\theta)\end{bmatrix}$

<hr color="lightblue">
Call the mass's <i>angular velocity</i> $\omega = \dot\theta$
Call the mass's <i>angular acceleration</i> $\alpha = \ddot\theta$

Note that in "dot notation," the number of dots denotes the number of time derivatives.
E.g., $\dot\theta = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$ and $\ddot\theta = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}$.

‚úÖ Note that $\dot\omega = \alpha$

<hr color="lightblue">
The dynamics of a rotating rigid body are governed by (the torque form of) Newton's second law $$\tau = I\alpha,$$where $\tau$ is the torque about the axis of rotation, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.

For our particular problem, the gravitational force on the pendulum's mass is $mg$, and the length of the perpendicular lever arm is $L\sin\theta$. Therefore, the torque about the axis of rotation is $\tau=mgL\sin\theta$. Additionally, recall (via Google or ChatGPT) that the moment of inertia of a point mass at distance $L$ from the axis of rotation is $I = mL^2$.

Substituting these facts into Newton's second law yields $$mgL\sin\theta=mL^2\alpha$$This implies$${\alpha = \frac{g}{L}\sin\theta}$$‚úÖ Note that $\alpha$ does not depend on $m$. What does this *mean*?

<hr color="lightblue">
Call the <i>state</i> of the system$$\xi = \begin{bmatrix}\theta\\ \omega\end{bmatrix}$$
In order to simulate, we need to discretize our physics in time. The very useful notation $\xi_k$ means "$\xi$ at time $t_k$." Call $h = 0.0167 \text{s}$ the <i>timestep</i>. If $\xi_{k}$ is the state of the system at time $t_k$, then $\xi_{k+1}$ will be the state of the system at time $t_{k+1} = t_k + h$.

‚úÖ Note that $h$ is one sixtieth of a second. Since cow runs at 60fps, this makes our simulation <i>real-time.</i>

<hr color="lightblue">

We can calculate the time derivative of a vector one component at a time, i.e., $$\dot\xi_k = \begin{bmatrix}\dot\theta_{k}\\\dot\omega_{k}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\omega_{k}\\\alpha_{k}\end{bmatrix}$$
<hr color="lightblue">
<b>Implement the following integration methods.</b>

<i>Forward Euler</i> is $\xi_{k + 1} = \xi_{k} + h \dot\xi_{k}$
It should gain energy over time.

<i>Semi-implicit Euler</i>, for our problem, ends up being $\begin{bmatrix}\theta_{k+1}\\\omega_{k+1}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\theta_{k}\\\omega_{k}\end{bmatrix}
+
h\begin{bmatrix}\omega_{k + 1}\\\alpha_{k}\end{bmatrix}
$
It should preserve energy over time.

<i>Implicit Euler</i> is $\xi_{k + 1} = \xi_{k} + h \dot\xi_{k + 1}$
It should lose energy over time.

<hr color="lightblue">
Note that $\xi_{k + 1}$ shows up on both sides of the Implicit Euler update rule. For our problem, this will make the update rule impossible to solve analytically for $\xi_{k + 1}$. We can instead solve for $\xi_{k + 1}$ numerically. A numerical technique called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_iteration">fixed-point iteration</a></i> works well for our problem.

For our problem, note that the time derivative of the next state is a function of the next state $\dot\xi_{k+1} = \mathbf{f}(\xi_{k + 1}).$
<details><summary>(Hint / Concept Check) Specifically,</summary>$$\mathbf{f}(\xi_{k + 1}) = \begin{bmatrix}\omega_{k + 1}\\\alpha_{k + 1}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\omega_{k + 1}\\\frac{g}{L}\sin\theta_{k+1}\end{bmatrix}$$</details>
Let's estimate the next state.
We can initialize our estimate of the next state with, e.g., the current state $\xi_{k + 1}^{est} \leftarrow \xi_k$
We can iteratively refine this estimate of the next state by applying the update rule
$$\xi_{k + 1}^{est} \leftarrow \xi_k + h \mathbf{f}(\xi_{k + 1}^{est})$$If this update converges (i.e., our estimate stops changing), then we know our estimate satisfies physics, i.e. $\xi_{k + 1}^{est} = \xi_{k + 1}$.

<details><summary>(Spoilers) Here is my fixed-point iteration for our problem:</summary><code class="x">vec2 curr = ...;  // $\xi_k$
vec2 next = curr; // $\xi_{k + 1}$
while (true) {
    // $\xi_{k + 1}^{est} = \xi_k + h * f(\xi_{k + 1}^{est})
    vec2 tmp = curr + h * V2(next[1], get_alpha(next[0]));
    if (IS_ZERO(squaredNorm(next - tmp))) { break; }
    next = tmp;
}

<b>b. linear blend skinning</b>

<hr color="lightblue">
<b>Note:</b> We won't actually write coordiante systems as homogeneous matrices to solve the homework problem.
However, the following derivation will give you a concise, general understanding of linear blend skinning.
I recommend drawing pictures as you read.

<hr color="lightblue">
Here is the general purpose 3D derivation.

Consider a skeleton made of bones.
Call $\mathbf{B}_j$ the coordinate system attached to the $j$-th bone in the skeleton, in world coordinates.
Note that for a 3D mesh, $\mathbf{B}_j$ will be a 4x4 matrix.

Consider a skin made of nodes.
Call $\mathbf{s}_i$ the position of the i-th node in the skin, in world coordinates.

Consider the skeleton and skin in a choice of <i>binding pose</i> (e.g., "T-pose", with the character's arms stuck straight out).
In the binding pose, we say that the $j$-th bone's coordinate system is $\mathbf{B}_j^{\text{bind}}$ and the $i$-th node's position is $\mathbf{s}_i^{\text{bind}}$, all in world coordinates.

Call ${}_j{\mathbf{s}_i} = \left(\mathbf{B}_j^{\text{bind}}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{s}_i^{\text{bind}}$ the $i$-th node's position in the $j$-th bone's coordinate system.

Now we move the skeleton around.

We can calculate $\mathbf{t}_{ij} = \mathbf{B}_j\ {}_j{\mathbf{s}_i}$ the position of the $i$-th node <i>if we had bolted it to the $j$-th bone when everything was in the bind pose</i>. Note that $\mathbf{t}_{ij}$ is in world coordinates.

In practice, rather than attach the node to a single bone, we <i>blend</i> the result of attaching it to each of the bones by means of a weighted average (a special kind of <i>linear combination</i> where the sum of the weights/coefficients is 1). Call $W_{ij}$ the <i>weight</i> of the $j$-th bone on the $i$-th node, where we are careful to ensure $\sum_j W_{ij} = 1.$ <b>Note:</b> the weights are computed (initalized) only <u>once</u>, typically with respect to the bind pose. I.e., the weights do not change over time. They are constants.

This way of calculating the position of the skin is called <i>linear blend skinning</i>:$$\boxed{\mathbf{s_i} = \sum_{j} W_{ij} \mathbf{t}_{ij}}$$
<hr color="lightblue">
For our simple 2D setup, the general-purpose matrix solution might be overkill.
Instead, we'll start from the idea that each (2D) bone has a 2D <i>position</i> $\mathbf{b}_j$ and a 1D <i>angle</i> $\theta_j$, both in world coordinates.
I recommend trying to figure how this approach works on paper; there are spoilers below if you get stuck or would like to see my particular solution.

<details><summary>(Hint / Spoilers) How to compute $\mathbf{b}_j$</summary>
We place the left side of the zeroth bone at the origin, i.e., $\mathbf{b}_j = \mathbf{0}$.
Then $\mathbf{b}_{j + 1} = \mathbf{b}_j + L_j \hat{\mathbf{e}}_\theta,$ where $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_\theta=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta\\\sin\theta\end{bmatrix}.$</details>
<details><summary>(Hint / Spoilers) How to compute ${}_j{\mathbf{s}_i}$</summary>
We have ${}_j{\mathbf{s}_i} = \mathbf{s}_i^{\text{bind}} - \mathbf{b}_j^{\text{bind}}$.</details>
<details><summary>(Hint / Spoilers) How to compute $\mathbf{t}_{ij}$</summary>
Finally $\mathbf{t}_{ij} = \mathbf{b}_j + \mathbf{R}_{\theta_j}\ {}_j{\mathbf{s}_i}$.</details>
<hr color="lightblue">
These snail functions may be convenient:

<code>vec2 rotated(vec2 a, real theta);</code>
returns the result of rotating a vector (or point) <code>a</code> counter-clockwise by <code>theta</code>, i.e., $\mathbf{R}_\theta\ \mathbf{a} = \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a_x\\a_y\end{bmatrix}$

<code>vec2 e_theta(real theta);</code>
returns a unit vector with angle <code>theta</code>, i.e., $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_\theta = \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta\\\sin\theta\end{bmatrix}$.

‚úÖ <code>e_theta(theta)</code> returns the same thing as <code>rotated(V2(1.0, 0.0), theta)</code>.

<hr color="lightblue">
Additionally, you are given a useful function <code>real point_segment_distance(vec2 p, vec2 a, vec2 b);</code>.

<hr color="lightblue">
<b>Implement forward kinematics (calculate $\mathbf{b}_j$ for $j=0,1,...,\text{NUM_BONES}$) in <code>update_skeleton(...)</code>.</b>
Once you are done, you should be able to move the skeleton around by pressing <code>'p'</code> on the keyboard or by playing with the sliders.

<details><summary>(Spoiler)</summary><code class="x">    b[0] = {};
    for (int j = 0; j < NUM_BONES; ++j ) {
        b[j + 1] = b[j] + L[j] * e_theta(theta[j]);
    }</code></details>
<b>Implement skinning (calculate $\mathbf{s}_i$ for $i = 0,1,...,\text{NUM_NODES} - 1$) in <code>update_skin(...)</code>.</b>
Once you are done, you should see the skin around the skeleton. <b>Note:</b> the skin will NOT behave as you might expect when you move the skeleton. This is A-OK. I have implemented incorrect but educational approaches to initializing the weights $W_{ij}$. Take a look in the code for <code>initialize_weights(...)</code> and see if you can figure out what is going on for mode 0 (only-zeroth) and mode 1 (all-equal). Does the skin behave as you would expect now? Cool! Let's implement some proper skinning modes.

<details><summary>(Spoiler)</summary><code class="x">    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_NODES; ++i) {
        s[i] = {};
        for (int j = 0; j < NUM_BONES; ++j) {
            s[i] += weights[i][j] * (b[j] + rotated(s_bind[i] - b_bind[j], theta[j]));
        }
    }</code></details>
<b>Implement rigid weights in <code>initialize_weights(...)</code>.</b>
In order to test rigid weights, switch the mode to rigid either by moving the slider or pressing <code>'k'</code> twice on the keyboard. A correct implementation of rigid weights should look like a rigid robot (very "angular"). There will be some "artifacts" where triangles overlap each other.

<b>Implement smooth weights in <code>initialize_weights(...)</code>.</b>
In order to test smooth weights, switch the mode to smooth either by moving the slider of pressing <code>'k'</code> three times on the keyboard (if you're in a rush, you could instead press <code>'j'</code> once). A correct implementation of smooth weights should look like a snake ("smooth"). All artifacts should be gone. :)
