<b>a. (10 pts) üü¢ Make a texture, and then update its data (very slowly on the CPU) to match the <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/new">shadertoy starter code</a></b>
<i>NOTE: I will code some of this live in class.</i>

<details><summary>‚ú® HINT</summary>
<code>uv</code> is the texture coordinates for a given pixel
Recall texture coordinates go from (0,0) in the lower left to (1,1) in the upper right. You have to do a little math to compute these yourself for each pixel.
(NOTE ! Don't confuse this with NDC!--which goes from (-1,-1) to (1,1).)

GLSL syntax is delightfully flexible, if also somewhat intimidating.
Let's break down line 7.

<code>vec3 col = 0.5 + 0.5 * cos(iTime + uv.xyx + vec3(0.0, 2.0, 4.0));</code>

- a GLSL <code>vec3</code> is three floats (very similar to snail's <code>vec3</code>)
- <code>0.5</code> is being added to a GLSL <code>vec3</code>, so here it translates to <code>V3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)</code> in snail
- for some GLSL <code>vec3 a;</code>, <code>cos(a)</code> is the same as <code>V3(cos(a.x), cos(a.y), cos(a.z))</code>
- <code>iTime</code> is the current time (i've already set up a time variable <code>t </code> for you); note that <code>iTime</code> is being added to a GLSL <code>vec3</code>, so in this case it translates to <code>V3(t, t, t)</code> in snail
- <code>uv.xyx</code> is an example of <i>swizzling</i> and translates to <code>V3(uv.x, uv.y, uv.x)</code> in snail</details>

<b>b. (40 pts) üü¢ Put a skybox on the fps camera's head. Add some islands and an ocean surface (Creative Coding)</b>

NOTE!: <a href="https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced/cubemaps_skybox.png">LOOK AT THIS PICTURE</a>

<b>c. (50 pts) Implement a software rasterizer.</b>

I have broken the development down into a (suggested) series of steps.
You will be graded on how far you got (e.g. if you have NDC color interpolation, you also score points for the single solid color version (regardless of whether you actually implemented it)).

NOTE: Ignore the <code>clip2</code> and <code>clip1</code> examples to start...

- (20 pts) üü¢ draw the triangles in a single solid color (e.g., blue)
              NOTE: the <code>cycle</code> and <code>tilt</code> examples should show up on the film plane
-  (5 pts) üü¢ NDC color interpolation (perspective-_incorrect_ interpolation; interpolate with NDC barycentric weights)
              NOTE: you should see the <code>cycle</code> example triangles in the correct colors but with _incorrect overlap_
              NOTE: you should see that the <code>tilt</code> example looks decent (but slightly wrong)
              NOTE: you don't need the pdf yet

<details><summary>‚ú® HINT</summary>
NDC (perspective-_incorrect_ color interpolation) would works like this (recall that homework where you dragged the colorful dot around inside the boundary of a triangle)
<code>perspective_incorrect_color = alpha_NDC * color_a + beta_NDC * color_b + gamma_NDC * color_c</code></details>
-  (5 pts) üü¢ (aside) set the fallback color to be <code>V3(.5, .5, .5) + .5 * face_normal</code>
              NOTE: the bunny should look fairly fabulous
- (10 pts) üü¶ implement a working z bufffer
              NOTE: you may need the pdf that i shipped with the codebase (but can probably get away without using it)
              NOTE: you should see that the <code>cycle</code> example has correct overlap

<hr>
<b>üí° let's talk about that pdf real quick</b>
<i>note: the pdf uses a different convention (z-axis points forward instead of -z-axis)
         this doesn't change the result of the derivation</i>

<u>tl;dr: when the pdf author uses linear interpolation between two points, you can substitute barycentric interpolation</u>

<details><summary>‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® EXPLANATION OF EQUATION 12 IN THE PDF</summary>
say we want to color pixel (i, j).
this pixel has position p_NDC in NDC (from the whole "double(i) / (S - 1) * 2 - 1" thing)

how did we get here?
well, we projected triangle (a, b, c) into NDC, and discovered that p_NDC is inside of triangle (a_NDC, b_NDC, c_NDC)
in particular, we found that its NDC barycentric weights alpha_NDC, beta_NDC, gamma_NDC are all greater than 0
(i.e., it passed the inside-triange test we briefly went over earlier in the course)

now, in addition to being the pixel position in NDC, p_NDC also corresponds to a point p _on the triangle_ (not a vertex, just a point p on the triangle)
in principle, we could write this point in camera coordinates as p_camera (to cross-reference the pdf, p_camera is the point C = (X_t, Z_t))
note that we do not have p_camera :(
we have a_camera, b_camera, c_camera, as well as a_NDC, b_NDC, c_NDC...
but no p_camera üò•

wait, but why do we care about p_camera at all?
well, what we really care about is p_camera.z (which i'll notate p_camera_Z)
this is the z-component of the point on the triangle we are currently drawing *in camera coordinates*); in the pdf, p_camera_z is Z_t
and p_camera_z would enable us to cleanly do depth buffering and clip planes, and also enable perspective-correct color interpolation

the first punchline of the pdf is Equation 12, which says that <b>we can compute p_camera.z, *using the NDC barycentric weights*</b>
in words, we barycentrically interpolate the _reciprocal_ of z_camera, and then take the reciprocal of that
in pseudocode, we compute p_camera_z = 1. / (alpha_NDC * (1 / a_camera.z) + beta_NDC * (1 / b_camera.z) + gamma_NDC * (1 / c_camera.z))

assuming Equation 12 is in fact true, we have recovered p_camera_z! üéâ

bonus: implementing clip planes is now a one liner üéâ

but we didn't come here to talk about clip planes; we came to this exceptionally long, drawn out hint to talk about depth buffering

let's assume p_camera_z is between our clip planes, i.e. in the range [renderer_f, renderer_n]
note that renderer_f, renderer_n are NEGATIVE in our convention

we want to map p_camera_z to "depth," which for us will should range from 0 to 255
(recall that depth_buffer.data is an array of unsigned char's)
we can use the contents of depth_buffer.data to do depth testing</details>

-  (5 pts) üü¶ implement clip planes
              NOTE: you will likely need the pdf that i shipped with the codebase
              NOTE: you should check that scrubbing <code>renderer_f</code> and <code>renderer_n</code> clips properly
-  (5 pts) üü¶ perspective-correct color interpolation
              NOTE: you will _definitely_ need the pdf that i shipped with the codebase
              NOTE: the tilt example should look correct (the difference is a bit subtle)
              HINT: see Equation 16 of the pdf


NOTE: Now, assuming all that was done perfectly...

-  (? pts) üè¥? (but with hints)  clip triangles to the near plane
              NOTE: you may have to rewrite and refactor large parts of the app
              NOTE: the <code>clip2</code> and <code>clip1</code> examples should no longer be broken
              HINT: the triangle in <code>clip2</code> will become 1 (different) triangle after clipping
              HINT: the triangle in <code>clip1</code> will become 2 (different) triangles after clipping
